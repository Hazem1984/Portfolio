Rockbuster Stealth LLC i s a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world.
My main task as a data analyst is using SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.in order to do that I used a data set that contains information (tables) about Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things.

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions they’d l ike to answer:
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based i n?
● Where are customers with a high l ifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

Write a SQL query to extract the average rental rate for each rating category?
SELECT rating, AVG (rental_rate) AS Avg_rental_rate
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY Avg_rental_rate DESC
